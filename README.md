# Custom 404 Page

This project is a custom 404 error page designed with **Bulma** CSS framework. The page features a dynamic "404" error message that adapts to different screen sizes and allows users to change its color using a range slider. The slider dynamically updates both the color of the "404" message and the gradient on the slider itself.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The size of the "404" message adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Color Change**: Users can change the color of the "404" message by using a range slider that cycles through the HSL color spectrum.
- **Real-time Updates**: The page responds in real-time to window resizing and color changes, ensuring that the content always looks great.
- **Bulma Framework**: The page is styled with the Bulma CSS framework, which offers a modern, responsive design with minimal effort.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. **index.html** – The main HTML structure of the 404 page.

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

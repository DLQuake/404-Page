# 404-Page

A 404 page is an error page that displays when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist or isn't available. To provide a better user experience, it's worth creating an interesting and interactive 404 page with animation.

In this repository, you'll find HTML, [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and JS code to create a 404 page with animated digits 404.

## How it works?
The 404 page consists of a `.hero` section with a gradient background and a `.title` containing the animated digits 404. The digit animation was created using CSS and JS.

Each digit has its CSS class `.four`, `.zero`, `.four`, and each class contains a CSS animation that animates the digit from top to bottom or from bottom to top. To achieve the effect in which the digits appear to be animated separately, we add an animation delay to each digit in the JS code.

In the `.hero` section, a CSS animation was used to change the background color and create a motion effect.

## How to use this code?
You can use the code in this repository to create your own 404 page with animated digits 404. To do this, clone the repository and run the `index.html` file in your browser.

You can also edit the code to customize it to your needs. In the HTML code, you can change the background, title, and page content, and in the CSS and JS code, you can change the digit and background animations.

## Summary
The 404 page with animated digits 404 is a great way to offer users an interesting and interactive experience, even when something goes wrong. With the code in this repository, you can easily create your own 404 page with animation.
